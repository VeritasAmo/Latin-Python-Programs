# Latin-Python-Programs

Benete! 

This project contains various python codes that does little things in latin, e.g., convert the days of the week from English to Latin. 

The Python codes are mostly beginner level, and the Latin involved is evolved step by step from beginner level to intermediate as well. This is a cool place to learn both the Python computer language and the classic language of Latin. 

I am neither a computer science major nor a Latin major, so there is a lot of improvments to make. You are welcomed to contact we with any suggestions! 

Valete, discipuli et dicipulae!
